    <pre>I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ah-oh-oh-oh

And they come unstuck

Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I gotta lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and head to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
She's been living on the highest shelf

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ah-oh-oh-oh

And they come unstuck

Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I gotta lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I gotta lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh, lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I gotta lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh, lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I gotta lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong and
I gotta lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong</pre>
